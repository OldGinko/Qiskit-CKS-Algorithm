# Qiskit-Childs-Kothari-Somma Quantum (CKS) algorithm 

To solve the Equation Ax = b we want to represent <br />
A<sup>-1</sup>≈Σ<sub>j</sub>α<sub>j</sub>e<sup>-iAt<sub>j</sub></sup><br />
We can achieve this with Hamiltonian Simulation (see below)




<ins>Matrix Inverse</ins><br />
The Hamiltonian Simulation is based on Qiskits *HamiltonianGate* Class (see: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.extensions.HamiltonianGate.html) 

<ins>How to use it</ins><br />
This part can't be used yet, I am working on implementing the equation above.
